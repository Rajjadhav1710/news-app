# news-app

NewsMonkey is a react based web-application which provides you the latest news. I now personally use it for my daily dose of news. I am just in love with this web-app. A special thanks to news API for providing the API for free(for developers only). Also implemented infinite scrolling and used fetch api to make http request.
